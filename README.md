# Project Overview

Welcome to my GitHub repository! 🚀 Currently available haptic/teleoperation frameworks either are expensive, provide low-range haptic feedback, or lack sufficient rotational degrees of freedom. To tackle these drawbacks, this project introduces an economical teleoperation setup, including two robots serving as master and slave. The system is actuated by encoder-equipped DC motors, and the applied forces are measured by load cells at the end effectors of the robots. ESP WROOM-32D boards are also used for time-delayed wireless communication. 

The manipulators are first designed in SolidWorks and then printed using a 3D printer. Stress and deformation analyses under a 5-kg load are also provided. The cost-effectiveness of the proposed system is highlighted by reporting the relatively low manufacturing costs. Furthermore, the technical specifications of our framework demonstrate its appeal as an alternative to current haptic devices, offering affordability and versatility.

In this project, basic electrical and mechanical aspects (design, analysis, and manufacturing) are reviewed. For additional information, you can refer to my paper titled “[Cost-effective Haptic Teleoperation Framework: Design and Implementation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377825397_Cost-effective_Haptic_Teleoperation_Framework_Design_and_Implementation).”
